# Machine Learning-Based Job Recommendation System
## Overview
This project is using NLTK , because job recommendation system is using job description for extracting the result.
## Features
 - ** Text processing: **NLTK is using for that.
 - ** Vectorization
 ## Requirements
 - python 3
 - NLTK libraries
 - pandas
 - Scikit-learn
 - numpy
 - Seaborn
 ## Data preprocessing
 - ** removed void/empty places
 - ** change to lowercase 
 - ** removing stop words
 - ** tokenization with NLTK
 ## Methodologies
 - ** preprocessing of data
 - ** vectorization
 - ** Input handling
 - ** Evaluation with metrics
 ## Algorithm
 - ** Didn't use any algorithm here, instead of that used NLTK for description extraction.
 ## Result
 - ** The job will recommend according to the keyword of description which user gives.
